CRUD REST API with Node.js and Express
This project involves the creation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API using Node.js and Express. The API performs data operations on a JSON file, serving as a simple data store. This approach provides a lightweight solution for managing and manipulating data without the need for a full-fledged database system.

**Features:**
**Create:** Add new data entries to the JSON file.
**Read:** Retrieve data from the JSON file. This includes fetching all data or specific entries based on provided criteria.
**Update:** Modify existing data entries in the JSON file.
**Delete:** Remove data entries from the JSON file.

**Endpoints:**
GET /users/getUsers : Retrieve all items.

**Technologies Used:**
**Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
**Express:** Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
**JSON File:** Used as a simple data store for persisting data.
