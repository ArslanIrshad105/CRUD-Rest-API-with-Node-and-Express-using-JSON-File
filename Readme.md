CRUD REST API with Node.js and Express
This project involves the creation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API using Node.js and Express. The API performs data operations on a JSON file, serving as a simple data store. This approach provides a lightweight solution for managing and manipulating data without the need for a full-fledged database system.
